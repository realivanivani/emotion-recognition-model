# Implementing AffectNet Dataset Processing

The AffectNet dataset is one of the largest datasets for facial expression, valence, and arousal estimation. Here's how to approach implementing code to process this dataset:

## Understanding the Dataset

From the paper, AffectNet contains:
- Over 1 million facial images
- Manually annotated for:
  - 8 basic expressions (including neutral)
  - Valence and arousal (continuous dimensions)
- A subset (about 450,000) has both categorical and dimensional labels

## Code Structure Approach

Here's how I would structure the code:

### 1. Directory Structure

```
affectnet_processor/
│── data/
│   ├── images/          # Raw image files
│   └── annotations/     # Annotation files
├── preprocessing/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── image_processing.py
│   └── metadata_extraction.py
├── dataloader.py       # PyTorch/TF data loader
├── config.py           # Configuration parameters
└── utils.py            # Helper functions
```

### 2. Key Components to Implement

#### Metadata Extraction

The paper mentions manual annotation files. You'll need to:

1. **Locate the annotation files** (typically CSV or JSON)
2. **Parse the annotations** which include:
   - Image paths
   - Expression labels (0-7)
   - Valence/Arousal values (-1 to 1)
   - Action units (if available)
   - Facial landmarks

## Important Considerations

1. **Dataset Access**: You need to obtain the AffectNet dataset which requires requesting access from the authors.

2. **Label Distribution**: The paper mentions class imbalance. Consider implementing weighted sampling or data augmentation.

3. **Multiple Tasks**: The dataset supports:
   - Expression classification (8 classes)
   - Valence/Arousal regression
   - Action unit detection
   - Landmark detection

4. **Data Splits**: The paper uses 280k training, 3.5k validation, and 500 test images for expression. Similar splits exist for valence/arousal.

5. **Evaluation Metrics**: 
   - For classification: Accuracy
   - For valence/arousal: RMSE and Pearson Correlation Coefficient

## Suggested Workflow

1. **Start with metadata**: First extract and understand the annotation structure
2. **Visualize samples**: Create a script to display images with their labels
3. **Implement basic loading**: Start with one task (e.g., expression classification)
4. **Add preprocessing**: Face detection/alignment if needed
5. **Create data splits**: Respect the original paper's splits
6. **Build data augmentation**: Especially for minority classes
